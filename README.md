# beyond

Beyond is one gRPC based, high performance, in-memory data structure store, used as cache, database.  
why gRPC: this will make it easy to be used by many programming languages in client side.  
why written in Golang: golang is easy to write parallel code and ultilize the CPU resources.  

# roadmap
- basic data structure support.
    - sortedmap.
    - hashmap.
- grpc support.
- rest api support.
